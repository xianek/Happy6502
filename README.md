# Happy6502
A webGL demo called "Happy 50th Birthday 6502"

You can view it live at:

https://krystone.pl/6502

Due to CORS the demo won't run when downloaded and opened from index.html file. You need to have at lest basic web server running. One of the ways to create a local web server is:

npm install -g http-server
http-server -p 8000

And then going to https://localhost:8000 in your web browser.

Or you can view/run serve.bat if you are on Windows. That might help.
