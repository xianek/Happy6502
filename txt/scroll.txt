Introduced in 1975 by MOS Technology, the 6502 became one of the most influential CPUs in history.

Its simple yet powerful 8-bit design helped power iconic machines such as the Apple II, Commodore 64/128, the entire Atari 8-bit range, 
VCS, and even the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). VLSI licensed 65c02 variant was also in the Atari Lynx. The list is too long to traverse it here.

Despite having only 56 instructions, it allowed for creative programming and helped drive the home computer and video game revolution, especially in the 1980s.

Today, computing enthusiasts and hobbyists continue to celebrate its legacy, proving that simplicity and innovation can change the world.

In 2025, we celebrate 6502's 50th birthday! So... Happy birthday 6502! In Poland, we'd say or sing "100 lat", but it's very likely that it will be a lot more than that. Sadly, you'll be long gone before your 6502 is...

Oh, well...

But don't be sad, you can use the mousewheel to play with the volume of the music and that's something to be happy about.

The music was arranged and produced by Moonshine Fox and previously released in 2022. I've asked him if I could use the track for this demo, and he was happy to let me do that. It's worth noting that the original song was composed by Jochen Hippel for a niche game named "A Prehistoric Tale" which was inspided by a C64 game "Dino Eggs". And, as we already know, C64 is 6502 based. While it is an absurd connection, I really liked the song and really wanted to use it here... Be sure to view the source code for more details... It's my first webGL work, so be gentle please...
